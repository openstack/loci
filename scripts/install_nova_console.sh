# Nova console is a special case. The html files needed to make this work
# exist only upstream. The "packaged" versions of these come only from
# OpenStack specific repos and they have hard requirements to a massive
# amount of packages. Installing from "source" is the only way to get
# these html files into the container. In total this adds less than a MB
# to the image size
